Imagine you're a new software developer at a firm that writes avionics software for commercial airliners. Quality control is critical, and developers work in small teams using Git for version control. You've heard of version control, but you've never used Git, so you're eager to catch up!

You decide to build a website that lets you and your friends share pictures of your cats, so you can learn Git in a fun environment before bringing that knowledge to work. You set out to build the site by using Git to keep track of changes and keep all the source code files backed up in case the server goes down. But before diving head-first into Git, you must cover the basics

In this module, you'll get an introduction to version control, and Git. Git can seem a little cryptic at first, and it can even be frustrating at times. But if you learn it step by step, you'll find that there's a reason Git is quickly becoming the world's most popular version control system—not just for software developers, but also for teams that write documentation and collaborate on other work.
