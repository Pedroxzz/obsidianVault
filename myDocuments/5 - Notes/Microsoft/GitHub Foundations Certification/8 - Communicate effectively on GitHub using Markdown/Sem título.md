Markdown is a markup language that offers a lean approach to content editing by shielding content creators from the overhead of HTML. While HTML is great for rendering content exactly how it was intended, it takes up a lot of space and can be unwieldy to work with, even in small doses. Markdown offers a great compromise between the power of HTML for content description and the ease of plain text for editing.

In this unit, we'll discuss Markdown's structure and syntax. We'll also cover features of GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM), which are syntax extensions that allow you to integrate GitHub features into content.

This unit is intended to give you a taste of what Markdown is about. For a more in-depth review, reference the **Markdown syntax description** and **GitHub-Flavored Markdown Spec** articles in this module's Summary unit.

## Emphasize text

The most important part of any communication on GitHub is usually the text itself, but how do you show that some parts of the text are more important than others?

Using italics in text is as easy as surrounding the target text with single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`). Just be sure to close an emphasis with the same character with which you opened it. Be observant of how you combine the use of asterisks and underscores. Here are several examples:

`This is *italic* text.
`This is also _italic_ text.`

Create bold text by using two asterisks (`**`) or two underscores (`__`).
`This is **bold** text.
`This is also __bold__ text.`
