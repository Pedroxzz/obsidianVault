This exercise walks you through the following steps:

- Install GitHub Copilot by using GitHub Codespaces
- Prompt GitHub Copilot for code suggestions
- Accept code suggestions from GitHub Copilot

## Instructions

1. Select the **Start the exercise on GitHub** button at the bottom of this page. It takes you to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges.
    
2. Select the **Start course** button or the **Use this template** feature in the template repository. This action prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend that you create a public repository, because private repositories use GitHub Actions minutes.
    
    After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.
    
3. Follow the instructions on the repository's **README** tab to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.
    
4. When you finish the exercise in GitHub, return to this module for:
    
    - A quick knowledge check.
    - A summary of what you learned.
    - A badge for completing this module.

 Note: You don't need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise. Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results.
