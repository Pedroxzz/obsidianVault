Letâ€™s review some key differences between traditional machine learning models and foundation models. Traditional ML models are typically siloed to perform specific tasks, like analyzing text for sentiment, classifying images, and forecasting trends. In order to achieve each task, customers need to gather labeled data, train a model, and deploy that model. 

The size and general-purpose nature of foundation models make them very different from traditional ML models. With foundation models, instead of gathering labeled data and training multiple models, you use the same pre-trained foundation model to adapt several tasks. Foundation models can also be customized to perform domain-specific functions that are differentiating to their businesses. This uses only a small fraction of the data and compute required to train a model from scratch.
