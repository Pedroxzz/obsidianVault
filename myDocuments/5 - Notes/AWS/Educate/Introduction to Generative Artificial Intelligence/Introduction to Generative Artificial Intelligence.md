Over the last several years, machine learning (ML) has rapidly expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of IT. Today, that expansion has entered the domain of generative AI. Generative AI is making it easier to innovate faster and reduce the number of hours needed for development. This provides you with more time to grow your business.

In this course, you are introduced to generative AI. You learn what generative AI is. You also learn about the benefits of generative AI, foundation models, and the services that AWS offers that you can use to build your generative AI solutions. 

### Course level 

This is a foundational level course that is written for learners beginning with cloud computing and AWS services. When you start this course, you don’t need to have a deep understanding of cloud computing.

### Objectives

  
By the end of this course you will be able to do the following:

- Define generative artificial intelligence (AI).
- Describe foundation models.
- Discuss use cases for generative AI.
- Identify the features and benefits of AWS generative AI services.

### Course layout

This course is self-paced, and you can take it in as many sessions as you like. You can stop and come back at any time. The course saves your progress. 

The course has two sections:  

- The first section is the content module. This is where you learn information and skills related to the content. You should expect to spend about 20 minutes completing the content. 
- The second section is the final assessment. You must pass the final assessment with a score of 70 percent or better to complete the course. You should expect to spend about 20 minutes completing the final assessment. 

### Course navigation

The course content opens in a new browser tab and is set to pause each slide by default. That means that you have to choose play on each slide to review the content. This feature makes the content more accessible to all learners.

If you don’t want each slide paused, you can choose to have each slide autoplay. Turn on **Autoplay slides** on the title slide. This changes the toggle from a grey pause button to a green play button. The slides will be set to autoplay for the entire course.
