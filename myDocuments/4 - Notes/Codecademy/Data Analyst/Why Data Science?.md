It’s Catherine’s first day working as a Data Science Intern at Codecademy! She’s excited to use some of the tools that she is learning in the **Data Scientist Career Path**, such as:

- Data Literacy
- Data extraction with SQL
- Programming basics with Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Python
- Data analysis using pandas, a Python library
- Data visualization using Matplotlib, a Python library
- Experimental Design and Hypothesis Testing

She is about halfway through the Data Scientist:

 Career Path. Soon, she will either pick a different specialty or stick with Machine Learning.

She’s excited to get to see some real Data Scientists at work before she has to choose!

> Machine Learning Specialist is one of four Data Scientist Specialist career paths, each of which starts with Data Science Foundations. Catherine is almost finished with the Foundations, and if she chooses a new specialty, her progress will transfer.


# Exploring Data with SQL
Like most organizations, Codecademy uses **SQL** (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage) to access its  database

Preview: Docs A database is a collection of structured information stored so it can be easily accessed and updated. In a computer system, databases are commonly accessed through a database management system, or DBMS.

A **database** is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured into _tables_. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records.

Spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, allow you to view and manipulate data directly: with selecting, filtering, sorting, etc. By applying a number of these operations you can obtain the subset of data you are seeking.

SQL (pronounced “S-Q-L” or “sequel”) allows you to write **queries** which define the subset of data you are seeking. Unlike Excel and Sheets, your computer and SQL will handle how to get the data; you can focus on what data you would like. You can save these queries, refine them, share them, and run them on different databases.

It is a great way to access data and a great entry point to programming because its syntax (the specific vocabulary that gives instructions to the computer) is very human-readable. Without knowing any SQL, you might still be able to guess what each command will do.

On her first day at Codecademy, Catherine wants to become familiar with the company’s data, so she connects to the database and uses SQL to explore the database.
