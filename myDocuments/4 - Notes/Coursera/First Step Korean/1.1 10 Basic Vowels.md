# Resumo
Hangeul é o sistema de escrita do coreano, considerado simples e lógico. Foi criado no século XV por King Sejong, originalmente com 28 letras, reduzidas hoje a 24 (14 consoantes e 10 vogais).

### Estrutura:

- Cada sílaba em Hangeul é composta por:
    - Uma consoante inicial.
    - Uma vogal medial.
    - Opcionalmente, uma consoante final.
- A escrita é feita da esquerda para a direita e de cima para baixo.

### Origem das Vogais:

As vogais básicas foram criadas com base em três elementos:

- **Círculo (ㆍ):** Representa o céu.
- **Linha horizontal (ㅡ):** Representa a terra.
- **Linha vertical (ㅣ):** Representa o homem.  
    A partir desses símbolos, as 10 vogais básicas foram derivadas.

### As 10 Vogais Básicas:

1. ㅏ (a)
2. ㅑ (ya)
3. ㅓ (eo)
4. ㅕ (yeo)
5. ㅗ (o)
6. ㅛ (yo)
7. ㅜ (u)
8. ㅠ (yu)
9. ㅡ (eu)
10. ㅣ (i)

### Pronúncia:

As vogais podem ser pronunciadas individualmente ou combinadas com consoantes voiceless para formar sílabas. Exemplos de pronúncia foram dados, como ㅏ ("a" em "father") e ㅗ ("o" puro).

### Escrita:

As letras são desenhadas com círculos e linhas em uma ordem específica, combinando traços curtos e longos para formar os caracteres.

### Prática:

O módulo incentiva a prática de leitura e escrita das vogais e palavras básicas. O conhecimento das vogais é essencial para consultar dicionários coreanos.

**Conclusão:** A prática constante permitirá a leitura fluente do Hangeul e o avanço nos estudos da língua coreana.

Hello everyone, in this module you will learn the Korean alphabet or Korean writing system called Hangeul. Now, I know, some of you may already be able to read and write it. But for many of you, this will be your very first Korean reading lesson.

If you have compared the appearance of Hangeul to other written language systems, such as Chinese characters or Japanese katakana, you will certainly have noticed some distinctive features. Hangeul, compared to those two, seems very simple—almost elegant in its simplicity—a collection of straight lines and circles. In fact, it is simple, one of the most simple and logical writing systems in the world, and we are justifiably proud of it.

Hangeul is composed of a consonant and a vowel forming one syllable. In each syllable, there is a beginning consonant (or initial sound), a medial vowel (or medial sound), and an optional final consonant character. Hangeul is written from left to right and top to bottom. In this module, you will learn the ten basic vowels, ten basic consonants, and other forms of vowels and consonants, so that you can read and write the Korean alphabet.

First, we will learn the ten basic vowels in Hangeul. Once you complete this unit, you will be able to understand the principles behind the ten basic vowels in Hangeul, and to read and write letters made of these vowels.

Hangeul, the Korean alphabet, was invented by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century. Do you know how many basic letters there are in Hangeul? Well, in King Sejong's time, when Hangeul was created, there were 28. This collection of 28 was given the name **Hunminjeongeum**, which translates as "Correct Sounds to Educate the People." Over time, however, some of the letters fell out of use, and now there are 24 basic characters: 14 consonants and 10 vowels.

Let's take a look at the vowels first. They were made of three characters. In Chinese metaphysics, these three symbols represent the three elements of the universe: Heaven, Earth, and Man. The dot symbolizes the sun in the heavens or the universe. The horizontal line represents the flat Earth or ground, and the vertical line represents the upright posture of man.

Eight vowels were created by attaching a dot to the four sides of these symbols. In Chinese philosophy, right and above are considered Yang, while left and below are Yin. Letters in Middle Korean assign dots to the right or above for light vowels (Yang) and to the left or below for dark vowels (Yin).

The first derived letters were created by attaching a dot to the left and right of the horizontal line or above and below the vertical line. The second-derived letters were created by attaching two dots to each side. These second-derived letters start with the sound "Yi" when pronounced.

Like I mentioned before, a syllable in the Korean language is formed with a consonant and a vowel, but we use a voiceless consonant to create a letter. These have the same sound. Shall we read the letters using the voiceless consonant?

Let’s pronounce the basic vowels together:

- **아 (A)**: Sounds like the "a" in "father."
- **어 (Eo)**: Sounds like the "o" in "ought."
- **오 (O)**: A pure "oh" sound.
- **우 (U)**: A double "o" sound as in "food."
- **으 (Eu)**: A unique sound, roughly like the "e" in "given."
- **이 (I)**: A double "e" sound as in "steel."

Now, let's add the second-derived vowels:

- **야 (Ya)**: Combines "A" with a lighter "Ya" sound.
- **여 (Yeo)**: Combines "Eo" with "Ya."
- **요 (Yo)**: Combines "O" with "Ya."
- **유 (Yu)**: Combines "U" with "Ya."

Together, these form the ten basic vowels in order: **아, 야, 어, 여, 오, 요, 우, 유, 으, 이**. This is also the order used in Korean dictionaries.

At this time, let’s practice writing the letters one by one:

- **아 (A)**: Write a circle, a long stroke top to bottom, and a short stroke left to right.
- **야 (Ya)**: Same as "A," but with two short strokes left to right.
- **어 (Eo)**: Write a circle, a short stroke left to right, and a long stroke top to bottom.
- **여 (Yeo)**: Same as "Eo," but with two short strokes left to right.
- **오 (O)**: Write a circle, a short stroke top to bottom, and a long stroke left to right.
- **요 (Yo)**: Same as "O," but with two short strokes top to bottom.
- **우 (U)**: Write a long stroke left to right and a short stroke top to bottom.
- **유 (Yu)**: Same as "U," but with two short strokes top to bottom.
- **으 (Eu)**: Write a circle and a long stroke left to right.
- **이 (I)**: Write a circle and a long stroke top to bottom.

Finally, let’s practice reading some words. Repeat after me:

- **가다 (Ga-da): To go**
- **보다 (Bo-da): To see**
- **먹다 (Meok-da): To eat**

That’s all for this unit. I hope you find time to practice reading and writing these letters as much as possible. Thank you, and see you in the next lesson!
