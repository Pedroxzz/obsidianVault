Prompt engineering begins with a prompt. This is the text that you input into the model. The model then generates a response to the prompt. This is known as inference. The result of the inference is displayed as the output. In this example, your prompt is: Where is Japan located? The model’s inference on the prompt returns an output that says, “Japan is located in the northwest Pacific Ocean.” The model might not always give you the output that you need. So, you might need to alter the prompt or provide the model with examples of the tasks in the prompt.
