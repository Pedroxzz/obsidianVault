Generative AI is a subset of machine learning. To help you understand the difference between traditional machine learning and generative AI, letâ€™s review some key differences. Traditional machine learning models perform tasks based on data that you provide. They can make predictions such as ranking, sentiment analysis, image classification, and more. However, each model can perform only one task. And to successfully do it, models need to be carefully trained on the data. As models are trained, they analyze the data and look for patterns. Then, these models make a prediction based on these patterns. With generative AI, models are pre-trained on massive amounts of general domain data, beyond the data that you provide. These models can perform multiple tasks. Based on prompts, such as code comments, the model predicts what the outcome should be and then actually generates that content. The AI-generated content comes from learning patterns and relationships that allow the model to predict the desired outcome.
