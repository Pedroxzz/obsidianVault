At the core of every AI generator is a foundation model. Foundation models are a class of powerful machine learning models that are differentiated by their ability to be pre-trained on vast amounts of data in order to perform a wide range of downstream tasks. These tasks include text generation, data summarization, information extraction, question and answer responses, and chatbot interactions. In contrast, traditional ML models are trained to perform a specific task from a data set.
