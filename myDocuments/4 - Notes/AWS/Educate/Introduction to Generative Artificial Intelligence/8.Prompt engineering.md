Generative AI architectures use prompt engineering to initiate an action from a foundation model. Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the prompts or input stimuli for a language model to generate specific types of output. Prompt engineering involves selecting appropriate keywords, providing context, and shaping the input in a way that encourages the model to produce the desired response. It is a vital technique to actively shape the behavior and output of foundation models.
