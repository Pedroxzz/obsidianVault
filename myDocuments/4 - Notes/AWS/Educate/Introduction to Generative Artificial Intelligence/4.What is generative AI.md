Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. AI generators are powered by machine learning foundation models. These models are capable of producing content, so you donâ€™t have to. This AI-generated content can be edited, so you can make the necessary modifications that meet your needs.
