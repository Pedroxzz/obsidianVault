**AWS Knowledge Badge**  
To verify your knowledge, or identify any gaps that you might have, take the knowledge badge assessment. Score 80% or higher and earn an AWS Knowledge badge that you can share with your network. The assessment is based on the courses in the learning path so we recommend completing these courses as needed. Already have some knowledge on Amazon EKS? Go directly to the assessment, test your knowledge. The score report will identify your areas of strength and direct you to the courses where you can improve any knowledge gaps.   
  
 

_**Are you wondering why your completion percentage has changed when you haven’t completed any new training?**_ It changes as you complete training, and when we add, remove, and update training content.
